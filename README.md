Aadu Puli Aatam.jar and "Project Pictures" should be in the same directory.

	First, The player who needs to move the coin, should click and hold the required coin, then  
the hold should be released at the required destination. This will move the coin from one place to another.
	Suppose, playing as a tiger and need to kill a goat, The tiger coin which should be used to kill the goat should be clicked and hold and then should be placed on the goat which is to be killed.
